AntiMicro Profiles
==================

This repository contains AntiMicro profiles that can be used to provide
controller support for desktop applications and computer games that do not
provide controller support or that provide poor support.

Currently, the layout of the repository is the following:

    applications -> APPLICATION -> Controller GUID -> PROFILE or ARCHIVE (tar.gz or tar.bz2)

Most applications will have profiles that are mapped against the special
SDL Game Controller API. The GUID that will be used in this repository for
this case is **sdlgamecontroller**. For people using AntiMicro on Windows,
anyone using an XInput controller (X360, Xbox One, Logitech F310 / F510 / F710)
will use an sdlgamecontroller profile. To find the GUID for your controller,
open AntiMicro and then go to Options -> Properties. The GUID of your
controller will be listed in the Properties window. For people using an XInput
controller on Windows, you can ignore what is shown for the GUID since SDL 2
does not return the device's real GUID or the pseudo GUID of "xinput" that
it uses for bindings.

If you compile AntiMicro from source, you must be using a version of AntiMicro
that was compiled with SDL 2 support. This will also require that you use at
least AntiMicro version 2.0 in order to use an sdlgamecontroller profile.

If you would like to submit a profile to this repository, please clone this
repository and place the XML file in the appropriate place. You also have the
option to create an archive file in either tar.gz or tar.bz2 format. Zip files
will **not** be accepted. If you are on Windows, please use 7-Zip to create
an appropriate archive file. Archives can be used to include a profile along
with supplementary files like a README, a controller mapping reference image,
and any configuration files that might be needed to change the bindings
in a game. Please do not include any exe files or the profile will
be rejected.

Once you have finished your changes, please submit a pull request
and I will review your changes. Once your changes have been reviewed and
nothing is wrong with the submission, I will accept the changes.
